<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="par">This recipe for tacos de alambre is an adaptation of an authentic recipe from a local restaurant in Las Cruces, New Mexico. We divide this dish into several meals by refrigerating the beef and vegetable mixture and cooking the bacon fresh each time.</p>

<h2 class="ing">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>8 slices bacon</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or more as needed</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
    <li>4 medium jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>32 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
    <li>4 medium roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><p>Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate, reserving grease in the skillet. Crumble bacon when cool.</p></li>
    <li><p>While the bacon is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon oil in another large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, jalapeños, and garlic; cook and stir until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Increase the heat to medium-high and stir in ground beef, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain off any excess liquid.</p></li>
    <li><p>Transfer beef mixture to the skillet with bacon grease. Stir in crumbled bacon until thoroughly combined; keep warm over low heat.</p></li>
    <li><p>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a clean skillet over medium-high heat. Place one tortilla into the hot pan; place a generous spoonful beef mixture onto the lower half of the tortilla. Cook until bubbles begin to form in the tortilla, then fold in half over beef. Continue cooking until taco is crisp and lightly browned on each side, 1 to 2 minutes total. Repeat to fill and cook remaining tacos, adding more oil as needed.</p></li>
    <li><p>Serve tacos with tomatoes and Monterey Jack cheese.</p></li>
