Hello! The current project consists of creating a recipes website in order to practice and put to test my newly acquired HTML and CSSskills. These recipes were copied and pasted from other websites (since I do not know how to cook any of these, yet I love them). The pages will look relatively weird since I am simply playing around with the different CSS propoerties.
